DALEK is a distressed, small caps typeface based on the lettering used in the Dalek Book of 1964 and in the Daleks strip in TV21 comic. The fonts have overtones of Greek, Phoenician and Runic alphabets.

Version 3.0 Dalek fonts include a full complement of Latin Extended-A characters and numerous subtle outline improvements. In addition to the original regular font, Heavy and Light weights are available, and each weight is now supplied with a new Italic (optically corrected oblique).

Also check out Dalek Pinpoint, a clean and precise version of the Dalek typeface.

You cannot legally give fonts to others or install it on their machines (with the exception of co-workers, your designer and your service bureau). You can embed fonts securely in non-editable documents.

A Commercial Licence permits @font-face use without any pageview limitations. Basic form field inputs are permitted, for example a search box or contact form, but providing remote users with the ability to edit, personalise and dynamically generate design using webfonts is not allowed. To incorporate a K-Type font file within your software product or your website to create user-generated graphics ‘on the fly’, or for use on an unlimited number of workstations, a more comprehensive Enterprise Licence should be purchased from k-type.com
